# Mine Game

## Objective
- A grid of 8x8 squares is given.
- The grid has a random number of hidden mines. There are at least 3 mines.
- A player begins at the bottom left corner of the grid.
- A player wins if they can reach the top row of the grid without stepping on 3 mines.
- A player can move up, down, left, or right - but not off the board!

## Approach
- Build the game using test-driven development.
- You can only build a console app or user interface (optional, not required) once the game is working.
